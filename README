Tango Color Palette
-------------------

The Tango Desktop Project exists to help create a consistent graphical user
interface experience for free and Open Source software.  See
http://tango.freedesktop.org for details.

This repository partially mirrors the CVS repository at
http://tango.freedesktop.org/static/cvs/tango-art-tools/, which is inactive as
of 2015-09-12.  It mirrors the color palette images, the original copyright
and author information, and the CVS changelog. All other files, having become
irrelevant over the years, are omitted.
